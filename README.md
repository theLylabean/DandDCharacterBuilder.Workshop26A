# Realmforge
*A Fantasy-Themed Dungeons & Dragons 5e Character Builder*

üõ°Ô∏è RealmForge is a React-based Dungeons & Dragons character builder that guides users through the 5e character creation process. Players can select a race, class, ability scores, spells, equipment, and craft a backstory ‚Äî then view a polished final character sheet styled like ancient parchment. I will be updating the app to add more features.

This project was built using the D&D 5e API and designed to feel immersive and easy to use for both new and experienced players.
